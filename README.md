The Base Harvest extension simulates logging and other forest management activities. This extension generally follows the behavior of the harvest module as described in Gustafson et al. (2000).

Changes to this extension are governed by the [**Repository Rules**](https://sites.google.com/site/landismodel/developers) from the Technical Advisory Committee.

Eric Gustafson is the Maintainer of this repository.
